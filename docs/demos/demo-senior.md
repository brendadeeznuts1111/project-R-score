# Senior Level Demo Document

## Advanced Markdown Features for Senior Testing 🔧

This document contains **complex** markdown features that senior developers should be able to handle.

### Enhanced Tables with Advanced Features

| Feature | Complexity | Performance | Security |
|---------|------------|-------------|----------|
| ~~Tables~~ | **High** | `Optimized` | 🔒 Secure |
| Math | Medium | 3.5x faster | CVE-2024-1234 |
| ~~Strikethrough~~ | *Low* | 50% improvement | ✅ Patched |

### Advanced Task Lists with Mixed States

- [x] **Critical**: Implement security patches
- [ ] **High**: Optimize performance bottlenecks
- [x] **Medium**: Update documentation
- [ ] **Low**: Add emoji support
- [x] **Critical**: Fix memory leaks

### Code Blocks with Multiple Languages

```typescript
// Senior-level TypeScript code
interface SeniorProfile {
  complexity: 'high' | 'enterprise';
  features: string[];
  performance: {
    throughput: number;
    memory: number;
  };
}

const seniorCode = new SeniorProfile({
  complexity: 'enterprise',
  features: ['crypto', 'middleware', 'advanced-parsing'],
  performance: { throughput: 74000, memory: 128 }
});
```

```python
# Senior-level Python integration
def senior_processing():
    """Advanced processing with error handling"""
    try:
        result = complex_algorithm()
        return optimize_result(result)
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(e)
        return fallback_result()
```

### Advanced Blockquotes with Nested Content

> **Senior Note**: This document demonstrates advanced features including:
> 
> > Nested blockquotes for complex information hierarchy
> > 
> > - Multi-level task tracking
> > - Performance metrics integration
> > - Security vulnerability tracking
> 
> **Performance**: 74K chars/sec throughput with `enterprise` complexity tier.

### Mathematical Expressions

Inline math: The performance improvement is calculated as $P_{new} = P_{old} \times 3.5$.

Block math:
$$
\text{Throughput} = \frac{\text{Document Size}}{\text{Parse Time}} \times \text{Efficiency Factor}
$$

### Advanced Links and References

[Bun Official Documentation](https://bun.sh/docs) with **external reference**

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) for `source code`

### Mixed Emphasis and Formatting

This text demonstrates ***combined emphasis*** with **bold and _italic_** together, plus `inline code` and ~~strikethrough text~~ for comprehensive testing.

### Footnotes and Advanced Features

Here's a reference to a footnote[^1] and another one[^complex].

[^1]: This is a simple footnote for basic testing.
[^complex]: This is a more complex footnote that contains multiple sentences and demonstrates how footnotes can handle more detailed information that might be referenced from multiple places in the document.

### Performance Metrics Table

| Metric | Junior | Senior | Lead | Enterprise |
|--------|--------|--------|------|------------|
| Parse Time (ms) | 0.6 | 2.9 | 13.2 | 72.0 |
| Throughput (K/s) | 62 | 68 | 74 | 74 |
| Features | 5 GFM | 15 GFM | 50 GFM | 200+ |
| Memory (MB) | 2 | 8 | 32 | 128 |

### Security and Compliance

🔒 **Security Level**: Enterprise  
📊 **GFM Compliance**: 95%  
✅ **CommonMark**: 92%  
🚀 **Performance**: 74K chars/sec
