🚀 SOPHISTICATED SECURITY HARDENING ANALYSIS DEPLOYED!

✅ determineHardeningLevel() Method - INTELLIGENT ASSESSMENT:
=========================================================

Core Logic Analysis:
• Environment presence detection (production > staging > development)
• Override-based hardening assessment
• Progressive security level determination
• Intelligent fallback logic

Algorithm Breakdown:
1. Check for production environment presence
2. Analyze production override count for hardening validation
3. Fall back to staging analysis if production absent
4. Default to development for basic configurations

🔍 Algorithm Intelligence:
======================

Production Detection:
• hasProd = chain.mergedInto.includes('production')
• Highest priority environment
• Indicates enterprise deployment readiness
• Expected maximum hardening level

Production Hardening Validation:
• prodOverrides = chain.overriddenKeys.get('production')?.length || 0
• Counts security-focused configuration changes
• Validates actual hardening vs. simple inheritance
• Differentiates true production hardening

Staging Fallback Logic:
• hasStaging = chain.mergedInto.includes('staging')
• Intermediate security level
• Pre-production validation environment
• Progressive hardening assessment

Development Default:
• Base configuration level
• Full inheritance with minimal security
• Development-friendly settings
• Starting point for hardening progression

📊 Hardening Level Matrix:
========================

Environment + Overrides → Hardening Level
─────────────────────────────────────────
production + overrides → PRODUCTION
production + no overrides → STAGING
staging + overrides → STAGING  
staging + no overrides → DEVELOPMENT
neither → DEVELOPMENT

🎯 Security Assessment Logic:
============================

PRODUCTION Level:
• Environment: production present
• Condition: Overrides detected (> 0)
• Meaning: True production hardening with security modifications
• Examples: debug: false, log_level: error, monitoring: enabled

STAGING Level:
• Environment: production present OR staging present with overrides
• Condition: Production without overrides OR staging with overrides
• Meaning: Intermediate hardening, pre-production security
• Examples: log_level: warn, debug: false, partial monitoring

DEVELOPMENT Level:
• Environment: staging without overrides OR neither environment
• Condition: Minimal or no security modifications
• Meaning: Development-friendly configuration
• Examples: debug: true, log_level: info, minimal security

🔧 Implementation Excellence:
========================

Type Safety:
• Return type: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production'
• Strict union type enforcement
• Compile-time validation of return values
• Type-hardened security level classification

Null Safety:
• Optional chaining: chain.overriddenKeys.get('production')?.length
• Null coalescing: || 0 for safe fallback
• Graceful handling of missing override data
• Robust error prevention

Performance:
• O(1) environment detection with Array.includes()
• O(1) override count lookup with Map.get()
• Minimal computational overhead
• Fast assessment for large configurations

📈 Advanced Use Cases:

Security Compliance:
• Automated security level classification
• Compliance validation against security standards
• Hardening verification for production deployments
• Security audit trail generation

DevOps Workflows:
• Pre-deployment security validation
• Environment promotion verification
• Configuration hardening assessment
• Security gate automation

Infrastructure as Code:
• IaC security validation
• Terraform/Ansible configuration assessment
• GitOps pipeline integration
• Security policy enforcement

🎨 Visual Integration:
====================

Color-Coded Display:
🟢 DEVELOPMENT: hsl(145, 80%, 45%) - Green (development-friendly)
🟡 STAGING: hsl(48, 100%, 60%) - Gold (intermediate security)
🔴 PRODUCTION: hsl(10, 90%, 55%) - Red (maximum security)

Table Integration:
│ Summary: 3 envs, 4 overrides, 8 inherited                         │
│ Hardening Level: PRODUCTION                                         │

Legend Integration:
████ Development Level   ████ Staging Level   ████ Production Level

🔍 Real-World Examples:

Example 1 - True Production Hardening:
{
  mergedInto: ["development", "staging", "production"],
  overriddenKeys: {
    production: ["debug", "log_level", "monitoring", "ssl"]
  }
}
→ Level: PRODUCTION (3 overrides detected)

Example 2 - Production Without Hardening:
{
  mergedInto: ["development", "staging", "production"], 
  overriddenKeys: {
    production: []
  }
}
→ Level: STAGING (no production overrides)

Example 3 - Staging Hardening:
{
  mergedInto: ["development", "staging"],
  overriddenKeys: {
    staging: ["debug", "log_level"]
  }
}
→ Level: STAGING (staging with overrides)

Example 4 - Development Only:
{
  mergedInto: ["development"],
  overriddenKeys: {}
}
→ Level: DEVELOPMENT (base configuration)
