🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Security: Hardcoded credentials in URL configuration
   • Impact: Potential security breach
   • Fix: Environment variable injection needed

2. Testing: Pre-push hooks blocking deployment
   • Impact: Reduced development velocity
   • Fix: Test isolation implemented

3. URL Management: Static configuration without validation
   • Impact: System failures when endpoints change
   • Fix: Dynamic URL resolution with health checks

🟠 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES:
1. Performance: Batch inspection regression
   • Impact: Inefficient processing for large datasets
   • Fix: Algorithm optimization needed

2. Monitoring: Limited observability
   • Impact: Difficult production diagnosis
   • Fix: Comprehensive logging required

3. Documentation: Outdated API specs
   • Impact: Developer confusion
   • Fix: Automated documentation generation

🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES:
1. Caching: No intelligent caching strategy
2. Error Handling: Inconsistent patterns
3. Configuration: Complex management without validation

console.log(`
✅ ENHANCED URL MANAGEMENT:
• Dynamic URL resolution with environment variables
• Automatic health checks with fallback mechanisms
• Categorized URLs (api, service, resource, external)
• Priority-based routing and timeout handling
• Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

✅ ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION:
• Production: Secure, optimized endpoints
• Staging: Testing environment with fallbacks
• Development: Local development servers
• Automatic environment detection

✅ HEALTH MONITORING:
• Real-time health checks every 30 seconds
• Automatic fallback to healthy endpoints
• Health status reporting and metrics
• Graceful degradation for failed services

✅ SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS:
• No hardcoded credentials
• Environment-specific configuration
• Secure header management
• Timeout and retry policies
