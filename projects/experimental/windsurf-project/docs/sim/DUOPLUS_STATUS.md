## ⚠️ **Current Challenge: Proxy Detection**

### **The Issue:**

The system has a proxy testing mechanism that's not recognizing the DuoPlus proxy configuration, even though:

- ✅ DuoPlus proxy is working on device
- ✅ Device shows US IP (101.36.98.74)
- ✅ Location is correctly detected as Virginia, US

### **What's Happening:**

```text
🌐 Loading live IP proxies...
🧪 Testing all proxies for location data...
✅ 0 working proxies with location data
✅ Loaded 0 live proxies
❌ Failed to create Apple ID: No suitable proxy found
```

---

## 🚀 **Solutions Available**

### **Option 1: Bypass Proxy Testing (Recommended)**

Since DuoPlus is already working, we can modify the system to use the device's existing connection without additional proxy testing.

### **Option 2: Add Proxy Credentials**

Configure the system with specific proxy credentials that work with the testing mechanism.

### **Option 3: Use Direct Connection**

Allow the system to work without proxy requirements since the device is already properly proxied.
