# Governance System

A comprehensive governance system for enforcing code quality, naming conventions, documentation standards, and bloat boundaries.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all checks
bun run governance:check

# Check specific areas
bun run governance:check:naming
bun run governance:check:docs
bun run governance:check:bloat

# Auto-fix issues
bun run governance:fix
```

See `GOVERNANCE_RULES.md` for detailed rules and configuration.
