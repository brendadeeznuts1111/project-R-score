# Dev HQ - Complete Feature Overview

## 🎯 Mission
Dev HQ is an advanced codebase analysis and automation platform built with Bun, designed to provide developers with comprehensive insights, monitoring, and tooling for modern software development.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Directory Structure
The project follows a clean, hierarchical organization:
- **`src/`** - Core TypeScript source code with organized modules
- **`dev/`** - Development tools, CLI, configurations, and infrastructure
- **`build/`** - Build configurations, outputs, and compiled artifacts
- **`docs/`** - Complete documentation suite (27+ files)
- **`tests/`** - Test suites (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
- **`bench/`** - Benchmarks and performance tests
- **`web/`** - Frontend assets and React dashboard
- **`.runtime/`** - Runtime data (databases, logs, sessions, monitoring)
- **`.env/`** - Environment configurations
- **`scratch/`** - Temporary development files

### Core Components
- **CLI Framework** - 15+ commands with multiple output formats
- **HTTP/WebSocket Server** - Built-in server with automatic TLS
- **Feature Flag System** - Compile-time and runtime feature management
- **Dashboard System** - Unicode-aware terminal UI
- **Monitoring & Health** - Real-time system metrics
- **Security Framework** - Headers, CORS, and authentication
- **Build Optimization** - Dead code elimination and bundling
- **Testing Infrastructure** - Integrated test runner with coverage

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun 1.3.6+ (primary), Node.js 18+ (compatibility)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0+ with strict type checking
- **Build System**: Bun's native bundler with optimization
- **Testing**: Bun's test runner with coverage reporting
- **Package Management**: Bun with zero-dependency philosophy
