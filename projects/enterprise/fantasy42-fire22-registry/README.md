## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Environment Setup**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fantasy42-fire22-registry.git
cd fantasy42-fire22-registry

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Setup development environment
bun run scripts/setup-fantasy42-registry.ts
```

### **2. Development Workflow**

```bash
# Start development server
bun run dev

# Run security tests
bun test tests/user-agent-tests.ts

# Build for production
bun run build:secure

# Run security audit
bun run scripts/security-cli.ts audit
```

### **3. Using the Registry**

```typescript
// Install packages
bun add @fire22-registry/fantasy42-security
bun add @fire22-registry/betting-engine

// Import and use
import { Fantasy42UserAgents } from '@fire22-registry/core-security';
import { SecureClientFactory } from '@fire22-registry/core-security';

// Generate enterprise User-Agent
const userAgent = Fantasy42UserAgents.generateEnterpriseAgent('FRAUD_DETECTION', {
  environment: 'production',
  buildVersion: '3.1.0',
  geoRegion: 'global',
  securityLevel: 'maximum',
  compliance: true
});

// Create secure client
const client = SecureClientFactory.createFraudDetectionClient('production');
```

---

## 🔐 Security Suite

### **User-Agent Security**

```typescript
import {
  Fantasy42UserAgents,
  UserAgentMonitor,
} from '@fire22-registry/core-security';

// Generate compliant User-Agent
const agent = Fantasy42UserAgents.generateEnterpriseAgent('PAYMENT_GATEWAY', {
  environment: 'enterprise',
  buildVersion: '4.2.0',
  geoRegion: 'eu',
  securityLevel: 'maximum',
  compliance: true,
});
// Result: Fantasy42-PaymentGateway/4.2.0 (enterprise) (Build:4.2.0) (EU-GDPR) (Sec:Maximum) (GDPR-Compliant PCI-DSS AML-Ready)

// Monitor User-Agent usage
UserAgentMonitor.trackAgent(agent);
```

### **Secure HTTP Client**

```typescript
import { SecureClientFactory } from '@fire22-registry/core-security';

const client = SecureClientFactory.createFraudDetectionClient('production', {
  geoRegion: 'us',
  buildVersion: '3.1.0',
});

// Automatic User-Agent and security headers
const response = await client.post('/api/v1/fraud/check', transactionData);
```

### **Real-time Monitoring**

```typescript
import { Fantasy42AgentMonitor } from '@fire22-registry/analytics-dashboard';

const monitor = new Fantasy42AgentMonitor('production');
monitor.startMonitoring(30000); // Monitor every 30 seconds

const metrics = await monitor.getMetrics();
const alerts = await monitor.getSecurityAlerts();
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Bun-Optimized Build System**

```json
// packages/core-security/fantasy42-security/package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:prod": "bun build --user-agent='Fantasy42Security/3.1.0' ./src/index.ts --compile --outfile=./dist/fantasy42-security --compile-exec-argv='--smol --no-macros --strict-validation'",
    "build:enterprise": "bun build --user-agent='Fantasy42Security/3.1.0-Enterprise' ./src/index.ts --compile --outfile=./dist/fantasy42-security-enterprise --compile-exec-argv='--smol --no-macros --real-time-monitoring --compliance-mode'"
  }
}
```

### **Cross-Platform Executables**

```typescript
// Build for multiple platforms
const platforms = ['bun-linux-x64', 'bun-windows-x64', 'bun-macos-x64'];

for (const platform of platforms) {
  await Bun.build({
    entrypoints: ['./src/main.ts'],
    outfile: `./dist/app-${platform}`,
    target: platform,
    compile: {
      execArgv: [
        '--smol',
        '--user-agent=Fantasy42-App/1.0.0',
        '--environment=production',
      ],
    },
  });
}
```

### **Enterprise Deployment**

```typescript
// Production deployment with security
await deployer.deployProduction({
  buildConfig: {
    target: 'bun-linux-x64',
    compile: {
      execArgv: [
        '--smol',
        '--user-agent=Fantasy42Prod/1.0',
        '--no-macros',
        '--strict-validation',
        '--environment=production',
        '--security-level=enterprise',
      ],
    },
  },
  securityConfig: {
    enableAuditTrails: true,
    enableFraudDetection: true,
    enableComplianceChecks: true,
  },
});
```
