## Waiting Room System

### What is a Home Place?
A "home place" is our waiting room system that allows you to:
- Join a barber's queue remotely
- See your position in line
- Get real-time updates on wait time
- Receive notification when it's your turn

### How It Works

1. **Join**: Scan QR code or use payment link to join waiting room
2. **Wait**: Monitor your position and estimated wait time
3. **Claim**: Barber claims you when ready
4. **Service**: Complete your appointment
5. **Pay**: Make payment if not already completed

### Status Updates

- **Waiting**: You're in the queue, waiting for your turn
- **Claimed**: Barber has claimed you and is ready to serve
- **Completed**: Service is finished
- **Cancelled**: Appointment was cancelled (may happen if you don't show up)

## Estimated Wait Times

Wait times are calculated based on:
- Number of clients ahead of you
- Average service time per client
- Barber's current availability

Typical wait times:
- **Short queue (1-2 people)**: 15-30 minutes
- **Medium queue (3-5 people)**: 30-60 minutes
- **Long queue (6+ people)**: 60+ minutes

## Tips for Better Experience

- Join the waiting room before arriving to save time
- Keep your phone nearby for status updates
- Arrive a few minutes before your estimated time
- If running late, contact the barber directly

## Auto-Accept Feature

Some barbers have auto-accept enabled, which means:
- You're immediately claimed when joining
- No waiting in queue
- Direct to service

## Cancellation Policy

- You can cancel anytime before being claimed
- After being claimed, please contact the barber directly
- Repeated no-shows may result in restrictions
