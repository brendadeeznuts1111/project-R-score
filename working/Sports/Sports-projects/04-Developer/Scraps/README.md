# Developer Scraps

This directory is for **temporary notes, quick ideas, and work-in-progress snippets** that don't belong in formal documentation.

## Purpose

## Guidelines

- **Temporary**: Content here is meant to be temporary
- **Informal**: No strict frontmatter requirements

  - Delete if no longer needed
  - Archive if historical reference needed
